# Mohammad Kherbek

I am a researcher and engineer with a strong academic foundation in **mathematics, machine learning, graph-based modelling, probabilistic systems**, and **complex system optimization**. My work combines rigorous theoretical modelling with practical implementation of intelligent systems.

## 🔬 Research Focus

During my Master’s program, I developed:

### **Knowledge-Graph-Driven Personalized Recommendation System for Social Networks**

This project explored:
- Construction and analysis of **semantic graphs** (using Last.fm data)
- Implementation of **KGAT**, **RippleNet**, **KGIN**, and **LightGCN** models
- Optimization techniques for large-scale recommendation pipelines
- Mathematical modelling, probabilistic reasoning, and system analysis  
- Techniques relevant to reliability modelling and fault-tolerant system design

This background directly supports work in:
- **Stochastic systems**
- **Predictive modelling**
- **Failure analysis**
- **MEC-supported redundant architectures**
- **Distributed intelligent systems**
